		<h2>Captain America 3 </h2>
		<p>
			Marvel's "Captain America: Civil War" finds Steve Rogers leading the newly formed team of Avengers in their continued efforts to safeguard humanity. But after another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps-one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for the Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other following Tony Stark's surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability.

		<h3>Reviews</h3>
		<p>
			But the new heroes aren’t the only ones who deserve praise. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. have never been better in their respective roles as Captain America and Iron Man. Evans performance is a little more subtle as he’s truly conflicted about the decision he’s making and the inevitable fight he will have to endure against his friends. Meanwhile, Downey has never been so reserved in his performance as Stark, who finally takes into account the weight of being a hero and the loss of life that can occur from his actions. While the funny quips are there every now and then, Stark has never been given such emotional complexity as he truly regrets having to beat the hell out of Steve Rogers, and faces the fruits of his superhero labor in more ways than one.

			<p>&#8220;By contrast, their final fight doesn’t have the spectacle as the first battle between all of our heroes, but that’s on purpose. While the airport battle is full of shots and a color palette lifted straight from the splash pages of comic books, this final fight is much more grim and emotional. Tony and Steve aren’t messing around anymore, and every single punch hits hard. Even the way Anthony and Joe Russo shoot this fight feels much grittier than the Bourne-esque opening action sequence, and the pure comic book battle from before. They’re directors who know how to shoot action with intensity while also having it mean something.&#8221;
